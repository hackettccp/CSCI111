"""
This program calculates the volume of a rectangular swimming pool.

The dimensions of the pool are given.

The program will need to print the volume in CUBIC FEET.

The calculation for volume here will be length * width * depth regardless of units.

Hint: You will need to convert the dimensions from meters to feet before calculating the volume 
      OR
      You will calculate the volume in cubic meters then convert to cubic feet.

Meters to Feet conversion: feet = meters * 3.28
Cubic Meters to Cubic Feet conversion: cubic feet = cubic meters * 35.31
       
You may create whatever other variables you need to perform the calculation/conversion.
