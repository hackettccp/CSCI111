Cups to Ounces

Create a program that asks a user to enter the number of cups.

You must use a function that accepts one argument (the number of cups)
that is used to calculate and return how many fluid ounces.

Hint: 1 cup = 8 fluid ounces.


EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT

Enter the number of cups: 3
That converts to 24 fluid ounces.
