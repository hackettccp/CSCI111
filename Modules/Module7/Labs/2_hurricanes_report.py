"""
Create a program to read in the data from the hurricanes.txt file which
the program will use to create a CSV file.

The hurricanes.txt file contains the number hurricanes formed during the
months of May through December in the years 2005 to 2010

For each year, have your program calculate the total number of hurricanes
formed and write this information to a CVS file in the following format:
Year,Total

The line in the CSV file (for 2005) should appear as:
2005,31

If done correctly, the CSV file your program creates will contain 6 lines
(one for each year)

This program does not require input from a user.
This program does not need to print any console output.
