/**
 * Car Object.
 * 
 * Create four private fields: make (String), model (String), year (int),  and speed (int).
 * Do not give the fields default/starting values.
 * 
 * Create one constructor:
 * It should accept three arguments (sets make, model, and year)
 * Set the speed field to 0.
 * 
 * Create accessors for each of the four fields.
 * 
 * Create a mutator named accelerate. Increase the speed field by 5 when it is called.
 * 
 * Create a mutator named brake. Decrease the speed field by 5 when it is called.
 * Include logic to prevent the value of the speed field from going negative.
