 * Create a game that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows
 * the user to continually guess the number, each time giving the user a hint
 * if their guess is higher or lower than the randomly generated number.
 * The program should stop when the user guesses correctly.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT
 * I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100
 * Enter your guess: 50
 * Too Low. Try again: 80
 * Too Low. Try again: 95
 * Too High. Try again: 90
 * Too Low. Try again: 93
 * You guessed the number!
