Leap Year Program

Create a program that asks the user to enter a year, and then print if that
year is a leap year or not. (During a leap year, February has 29 days instead
of 28)

Prompt the user to enter the year

Print if the year is a leap year or not.

A leap year occurs under one of the following two conditions:
The year is evenly divisible 100 and also evenly divisible by 400
  For example, the years 1700 and 2100 are not leap years, but 1600 and 2000 are.
The year is not evenly divisible by 100 but is evenly divisible by 4
  For example, the years 2002 and 1997 are not leap years, but 2000 and 2004 are.


EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT

Example 1
Enter the year: 2001
2001 is not a leap year.

Example 1
Enter the year: 1996
