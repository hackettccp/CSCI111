/**
 * Create a program that calculates the annual sales amounts of a user-specified number of stores.
 * The user will then enter the sales for each quarter (4 per year). After all data has been supplied,
 * print the total annual sales for each store. Store all sales data into a two-dimensional array.
 * 
 * Prompt the user to enter the number of stores.
 * For each store, prompt the user to enter the total sales for each quarter. Store each into value into a
 * single two-dimensional array.
 * After all data has been entered, use the two-dimensional array's data to calculate and print
 * the total for each store.
 *
 * 
 * EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
 * Enter the number of stores: 3
 * Enter the number of sales for store 1, quarter 1: 100
 * Enter the number of sales for store 1, quarter 2: 200
 * Enter the number of sales for store 1, quarter 3: 100
 * Enter the number of sales for store 1, quarter 4: 300
 * Enter the number of sales for store 2, quarter 1: 150
 * Enter the number of sales for store 2, quarter 2: 275
 * Enter the number of sales for store 2, quarter 3: 300
 * Enter the number of sales for store 2, quarter 4: 100
 * Enter the number of sales for store 3, quarter 1: 200
 * Enter the number of sales for store 3, quarter 2: 200
 * Enter the number of sales for store 3, quarter 3: 300
 * Enter the number of sales for store 3, quarter 4: 300
 * 
 * Total sales for store 1: 700
 * Total sales for store 2: 825
 * Total sales for store 3: 1000
