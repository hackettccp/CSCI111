"""
Create a program that prompts the user to enter
two numbers and calculates the average.

The first number must be greater than zero and
less than or equal to fifty.
If the user enters a value outside of that range,
prompt the user to try again and enter a valid number.

The second number must be greater than fifty and
less than or equal to one hundred.
If the user enters a value outside of that range,
prompt the user to try again and enter a valid number.

Using the two validated numbers, compute and print the average.
The average is the sum of the two numbers divided by two.
